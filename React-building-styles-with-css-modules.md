# React: Building Styles with CSS Modules

## Summary
Apprentices will learn to integrate css styling with React applications

> React styles and CSS styles haven't always agreed in the use of inline styling. As React development has grown, developers have figured out more and more ways of smoothly integrating and maintaining a style with their code. But with so many options, it may be confusing on where to get started, especially if youâ€™ve worked with CSS on non-React-based projects. In this course, Emmanuel Henri brings some clarity to your options and introduces the concepts and syntax for CSS modules with React. Whether you need to style a React-based user interface or want to create dramatic animation, this course gives you the keys you need to build an attractive and maintainable style using React and CSS modules.

## Directions
This course may be initially difficult to follow.  Download and unzip the excercise files.

There are multiple project structures--folder structures, naming conventions, component hierarchy--for setting up a project.  Emmanuels approach is common and a great example to learn from.

Although Emmanuel recommends copying the code inside the excercise file (especially for re-writing the template for each component), I recommend *take the time* and write the code.  Copy code when you feel comfortable writing it from memory. 

### Introduction

### Setting up
Follow along this chapter to start with a clean project.  You should feel comfortable starting your own react application.

### Basics of CSS
Emmanule says
>  And by the way, if you want to insert them inside of a component folder, so you can basically have less stuff inside of the source folder, feel free to do so.

Most component based JavaScript frameworks have a folder for each component. Each component folder contains all the files for the that component.  Component folders are located inside the src folder.

Emmanuel says to try changing the values in his CSS.  Change the CSS values to help understand his code and the css properties.  This is also a reminder of common css properties.  Look up the properties on CSS Tutorial at W3 Schooles or other sites as needed.

### Interaction and Responsive Design

In the *SVG loaading with state* section, Emmanuel uses bind.  You may optionally learning more about `.bind()` at [MDN Function.prototype.bind()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind).
