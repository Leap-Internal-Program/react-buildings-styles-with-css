# React: Building Styles with CSS Modules

## Summary
Apprentices will integrate CSS styling within React application.  The LinkedIn Learning summary says:

> React styles and CSS styles haven't always agreed in the use of inline styling. As React development has grown, developers have figured out more and more ways of smoothly integrating and maintaining a style with their code. But with so many options, it may be confusing on where to get started, especially if youâ€™ve worked with CSS on non-React-based projects. In this course, Emmanuel Henri brings some clarity to your options and introduces the concepts and syntax for CSS modules with React. Whether you need to style a React-based user interface or want to create dramatic animation, this course gives you the keys you need to build an attractive and maintainable style using React and CSS modules.

## Directions
This course may be initially difficult to follow.  Download and unzip the exercise files.  Take the quiz at the end of each chapter.

Although Emmanuel recommends copying the code inside the exercise files (especially for re-writing the template for each component), I recommend *take the time* and write the code.  Start copying code after you feel you could have written it from memory. 

Before beginning this LinkedIn Learning lesson on building styles with CSS modules, **watch the 1 minute and 40 second** section titled, *React Hooks History* in Eve's [React Hooks](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-hooks/react-hooks-history?autoAdvance=true&autoSkip=false&autoplay=true&resume=false) course.  Eve addresses the history of React and using functional components vs class components.

### Introduction

### Setting up
Follow along this chapter to start with a clean project.  You should feel comfortable starting your own react application.

### Basics of CSS
Emmanuel says
>  And by the way, if you want to insert them inside of a component folder, so you can basically have less stuff inside of the source folder, feel free to do so.

Most component-based JavaScript frameworks have a folder for each component. Each component folder contains all the files for the that component.  Component folders are located inside the src folder.

Emmanuel says to try changing the values in his CSS.  Change the CSS values to help understand his code and the css properties.  This is also a reminder of common css properties.  Look up the properties on CSS Tutorial at W3 Schools or other sites as needed.

In the *SVG loading with state* section, Emmanuel uses bind.  You may optionally learning more about `.bind()` at [MDN Function.prototype.bind()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind).
